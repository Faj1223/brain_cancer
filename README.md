# Brain MRI Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on training and evaluating deep learning models to detect and predict brain cancer from MRI images. The goal is to build probabilistic and deterministic models, such as ResNet and other state-of-the-art architectures, to classify MRI images as either cancerous or non-cancerous.

# Project Objectives:
# Model Training: 
Train several deep learning models to classify brain MRI images.
# Hyperparameter Optimization: 
Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve model accuracy and generalization.
# Performance Evaluation: 
Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
# Learning Curve Analysis: 
Visualize training and validation loss/accuracy to monitor learning progress.
# Model Comparison:
Compare the performance of multiple architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) to determine the best-performing model.
# Visualization: 
Generate graphs to analyze model performance and showcase results.
# Dataset:
The project uses a publicly available MRI dataset containing labeled images for cancerous and non-cancerous cases.
